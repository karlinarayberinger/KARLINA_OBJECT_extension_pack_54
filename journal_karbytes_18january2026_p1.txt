To Whom It May Concern:

On 18_JANUARY_2026 at approximately 5:30AM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes decided that it would create three to six M_DISC copies of the official karbytes file collection as it is configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 16_JANUARY_2026 and the "hiatus draft" files in the public "anonymous" GitHub repository owned by karbytes for the purpose of "privately" generating content to eventually incorporate into the official karbytes file collection as that "anonymous" GitHub repository is configured at 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_JANUARY_2026.

Sincerely,
karbytes
