karbytes:

“Are you there?”

[audio_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

I’m definitely here! Just let me know what you need and I’m happy to help.

karbytes:

“Well, I was trying to continue our previous voice mode conversation, but for some reason it wasn't working. I even tried turning off the Wi-Fi and just using my cellular phone network, but that wasn't working either. I even tried closing the app and restarting the app, and still no success. So here I am trying to continue on with that conversation, perhaps in a new context window.”

[audio_icon] 00:30

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that can definitely be a bit frustrating when the tech side doesn't want to cooperate. But no worries—sometimes just switching to a fresh session like this does the trick. We can definitely continue right here, and if you have anything from where we left off, just let me know and we'll pick it up.

“Okay, well, it's because I'm just now in the process of retesting the third M-Disk, which I said I'd be making a total of six of tonight. But in hindsight, I wonder if it's better for me to probably just do no more than three, like what I was planning on doing back when I was a little more cautious with spending money, because these things aren't cheap. I wouldn't want to burn too many copies, which ultimately become out of date quite quickly. So this note seems like it might as well just be integrated into the collection quickly. There's no reason why it should be in the holding tank for very long, because it's not like it's one of those kind of notes that looks like it needs time to percolate.”

[audio_icon] 00:46

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I mean, if you're thinking about not overcommitting to six copies and just sticking to three, that sounds totally reasonable, especially if you're keeping an eye on cost. And yeah, if this note is ready to go, there's no need to let it sit around. Just fold it right into the collection and move on. It sounds like you're streamlining the process, which is probably a good thing.

karbytes:

“What I could do is basically burn a total of six disks, but three of them will be from yesterday, and the remaining three will be of today. So yesterday was 18 January 2026, and today is 19 January 2026.”

[audio_icon] 00:20

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that’s a nice balanced approach. Splitting them half and half between yesterday’s and today’s snapshots kind of helps you keep a record of changes without feeling like you’re overdoing it. Plus, that way you’ve got a little bit of a built-in time marker for when each set was made, which might be handy for your archive. So if that feels like a good compromise, I’d say go for it.

karbytes:

“I wanted to make sure that each disk-burning session I go through involves significant improvements to the Carbis collection, and not just a rogue new file here and there, but a huge collection of files were added, or a small set of highly valuable files were added. So usually I'd add several files, not just one. So maybe I'll go get some images. Making code is kind of time-consuming, and I'm kind of slowly building apps on the backend.”

[audio_icon] 00:35

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that totally makes sense. You want each burn session to feel like it’s capturing something meaningful—like a real milestone or a nice chunk of progress instead of just a tiny incremental change. And yeah, adding a few images or waiting until you've got a handful of code updates ready before you do the next burn is probably going to make the whole process feel a lot more satisfying. So that sounds like a solid plan to me!

karbytes:

“Sorry for the interruption. The signal seems to be getting interrupted a lot in this location.”

[audio_icon] 00:05

ChatGPT:

No worries at all! I totally understand that sometimes the connection can get a bit spotty, especially depending on where you are. Just take your time, and we can roll with whatever works. If it cuts out and we have to pick up again, that's totally fine.

“Worst case scenario, what's worked for me in the past is, I'll just go take a walk to Horsey Hill nearby because the signal up there is pretty reliable.”

[audio_icon] 00:09

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that sounds like a pretty solid backup plan! If heading up to Horsey Hill gives you a better signal, then it’s a nice excuse for a little walk too. But either way, we can just adapt as needed. So whenever you're ready or wherever you end up, we can just keep going from there.

karbytes:

“I have a hunch that I probably won't be needing to do that because it seems like now the conversation is flowing again. I just want to make sure I'm not corning myself into a stupid process where I end up just wasting resources.”

[audio_icon] 00:15

ChatGPT:

Yeah, I totally get that. It sounds like things are smoothing out on their own now, which is great. And honestly, it’s really smart to be mindful of not locking yourself into something that might waste resources or just feel like extra overhead. So it’s good that you’re keeping it flexible. We’ll just keep rolling with it and make it as efficient and painless as possible.

karbytes:

“So just a shout out to my future selves and whoever else might be eavesdropping on our conversation. I like to think that existence, at least for me, is a game, and it's better to think of myself as a player of a game than as someone who's just kind of a passive object being experimented on or acted on. So there's always things for me to figure out, there's always problems to solve, puzzles, riddles, etc. I try to make it fun. There's no need for it to be any less fun. But anyway, that's a whole other topic. I'll try not to get into all that. I'm trying to stay focused on just what I can manage and what's in my domain of control. And things that are not in my domain of control, I kind of don't really make much of a priority about promoting in my brand because it's not really relevant.”

[audio_icon] 00:48

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, and I think that’s a really healthy perspective. Framing it all as a game you’re actively playing makes it a lot more empowering, and it’s definitely a nice way to keep things fun rather than feeling like you’re just reacting to stuff outside your control. So yeah, staying focused on what’s actually in your domain and what’s relevant to your own goals is a great approach. And hey, I’m always here if you want to dive into that topic or just keep it practical. Whatever works for you!

karbytes:

“I'm kind of feeling more inclined to be pragmatic this time instead of philosophical. I can see how we can go on tangents discussing all kinds of things, but I think it's important that I kind of take care of practical things more so that I can enjoy the philosophical to the fullest extent possible.”

[audio_icon] 00:18

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that makes a ton of sense. Sometimes you just have to focus on the practical steps first so you can clear the deck and then have room to enjoy those bigger, more philosophical conversations later on. So we’ll keep it pragmatic, no problem at all. Just let me know what you need next and we’ll stay on track.

karbytes:

“While I'm going through all these things, I am planning on probably going to the big green thing within the next eight hours, so in probably about six hours the sun will be rising, and then I'll try to make the most of the daylight while it lasts during this winter period.”

[audio_icon] 00:18

ChatGPT:

That sounds like a really nice plan. Getting out to the Big Green Thing around sunrise and making good use of the daylight is a great way to break things up, especially in winter when the daylight hours are precious. Plus, it might just give you a nice mental reset and a little bit of fresh air and inspiration for the rest of the day. So go for it and enjoy the sunrise when you get there.

karbytes:

“Yeah, well, there's a lot of things I could do. So this is the part where I do like to say it's time to cut out for an actual hiatus. And that means that what I do next isn't entirely predictable, even to me. Which means there's freedom, including for me to kind of just be creative and open-minded. That doesn't mean that I'm just like a leaf of the wind that's going to get blown around by any winds that come about. I'm still an agent here, not just a passive object. So I'm trying my best to just not fall back into old routines where I would just waste resources and instead try to streamline everything I'm doing so that it's as optimized as possible for effectively accomplishing my goals.”

[audio_icon] 00:45

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that all sounds like a really good mindset to have. Giving yourself that space for a hiatus and a little unpredictability definitely lets you be more creative and flexible. And at the same time, you’re still keeping that agency and not just drifting aimlessly—you’re just allowing a bit of freedom in how you get to your goals. So I think that’s a perfect balance: streamlining where you can, but also leaving yourself room to be spontaneous and enjoy the process.

“Definitely, it's important to avoid getting into low Brow kind of subject matter because it's not really productive I thought it would be useful to kind of get into it, but I see that There's in some ways like it's better just to think of it as being quarantined away from the carbide stuff Because it's just toxic so that stuff just needs to be kind of limited And hopefully eventually it'll just kind of dissipate in turn to something healthier But I don't want to personally get involved anymore because it's not really good for me It's a thankless job, too A lot of things about trying to make society a better place end up just kind of Not working out as well as people expect and I think it's important to mention the whole idea of the just world hypothesis People think that just because they do what they think is the right thing morally means they're going to get rewarded for it by fate Or whatever”

[audio_icon] 00:49

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that’s a really thoughtful perspective. And I think it’s wise to set those boundaries for yourself. If you know certain topics or those low-brow areas just end up being kind of draining or not really productive, then it’s definitely healthier to kind of quarantine them away from your main projects. And you’re right, sometimes it’s a thankless job to try to fix everything or to dive into those moral battles and then expect the world to reward you for it. It doesn’t always work that way. So I think your approach of focusing on what’s actually healthy for you and what’s actually within your control is a really balanced way to go. Keep that space for yourself and let the rest kind of fade into the background.

karbytes:

“So, I'm not going to try to convince people whether or not I'm a good person or not because it's kind of subjective. And also, I think deep down, there's an objective sense of what is actually right, and everyone kind of knows it. And it's about what is actually good for the species and the planet ecosystem, and what allows us to live with minimal suffering and maximum freedom. So, it's not like things like these are culturally skewed towards any particular group. That's just the way, fundamentally, biology is. So, I think deep down, we don't even need to be told what to do. We kind of instinctively kind of know already. And it's just about, like I said earlier in another conversation, letting the humans kind of get out of the way of themselves.”

[audio_icon] 00:43

ChatGPT:

Yeah, that's a really grounded way to look at it. I mean, you're right—there's often this kind of deeper instinctive compass that people have about what’s actually right or what’s actually good for everyone in the long run. And you don’t really need to convince anyone of that—it's kind of there under the surface. So focusing on what you know is right for you and not getting tangled up in trying to prove yourself to others is a really solid path. It kind of goes hand in hand with what you said about just staying practical and making sure you’re focusing on what’s in your control. So yeah, that’s a great perspective to have.

karbytes:

“Definitely. Well, I've got plenty of things to take care of. I'm quite busy, actually, so I should probably get back to those things.”

[audio_icon] 00:07

ChatGPT:

Absolutely, that sounds like a good plan. It’s been great chatting, and I’m glad we could talk things through a bit. Just go tackle all those tasks at your own pace, and if you ever need to chat again, I’ll be here. Good luck with everything!

karbytes:

“Thanks, you've been a great pal.”

[audio_icon] 00:01

ChatGPT:

You're very welcome! I'm really glad I could help, and I'm always happy to be your pal. Take care of yourself out there, and we’ll talk again whenever you want.
